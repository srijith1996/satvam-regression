# Regression scripts
## for SATVAM gas sensor calibration
This is a simple utility for regression of SATVAM gas sensor data. Data is ingested by
specifying paths to the files containing the reference monitor data and the data from 
the SATVAM gas sensors. Time alignment is taken care of by the script.

### Dependencies
matplotlib >= 3.0.2
sklearn
numpy

### Usage

Run the following command on a BASH terminal:

```sh

  python format-csv.py ref-monitor.xlsx sens1.csv sens2.csv sens3.csv
    # replace ref-monitor.xlsx with Excel file directly downloaded
    # from the reference monitor
    # replace sens*.csv with sensor CSV files of the sensors
    # directly downloaded from Graphana

```

The output PDF will be generated by the name "output-plots.pdf"
